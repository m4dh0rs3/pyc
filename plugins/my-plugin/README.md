This is a private clone of Polycentrics, a game by Angelo Mazotti. The original was initially implemented by `OrionLab` and published by [GAMMAGRAPHICS SRLS](https://www.gammagraphics.eu/)

#### Technical
Polycentric curves are approximated by line seqments of a graph. If the PCCS intersects itsels, two nodes of the intersector's lines are connected. Every permutation of the graph is used to detect closed paths with colored breadth-first-search to classify areas contained in the PCCS.
