# Polycentrics ⤵️⤴️

### Warning unstable!
## Tutorial

Two players alternate choosing unique tiles of radii 1 to 3 and 4 directions
to append to the end of the last tile, shaping a path on the board. If such
intersects itself, all points enclosed by its shape are taken by the player
who closed the path. He aims to accumulate the most points and not to steer
outside the board.
