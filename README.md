# Polycentrics

### Tutorial

Two players alternate choosing unique tiles of radii 1 to 3 and 4 directions to append to the end of the last tile, shaping a path on the board. If such intersects itself, all points enclosed by its shape are taken by the player who closed the path. He aims to accumulate the most points and not to steer outside the board.
